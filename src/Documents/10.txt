>10. Generative models for chemical structures.
We apply recently developed techniques for pattern recognition to construct a
generative model for chemical structure. This approach can be viewed as
ligand-based de novo design. We construct a statistical model describing the
structural variations present in a set of molecules which may be sampled to
generate new structurally similar examples. We prevent the possibility of
generating chemically invalid molecules, according to our implicit hydrogen
model, by projecting samples onto the nearest chemically valid molecule. By
populating the input set with molecules that are active against a target, we show
how new molecules may be generated that will likely also be active against the
