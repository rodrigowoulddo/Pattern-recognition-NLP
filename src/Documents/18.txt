>18. Computer-assisted structure-activity relationships of nitrogenous cyclic compounds tested in salmonella assays for mutagenicity.
Study of the relationship between mutagenicity and molecular structure for a data
set of nitrogenous cyclic compounds is reported. A computerized SAR system
(ADAPT) was utilized to classify a data set of 114 nitrogenous cyclic compounds
with 19 molecular descriptors. All of the descriptors represented at least 10% of
the compounds in the data sets. The average correct predictability of the data
base was calculated to be 89% after evaluating 100 training/prediction subsets.
The actual predictive ability of the discriminants generated by the ADAPT system 
was demonstrated by predicting the mutagenicity of structurally similar compounds
not in the data set. Weight vectors generated in the pattern recognition programs
were used to predict the bacterial mutagenicity of 10 compounds which were not
included in the data set. All of the compounds were predicted correctly which was
actually better than the 89% calculated by the system. This displayed the ability
of the system of classify compounds as mutagenic or nonmutagenic by using
molecular descriptors and to predict the biological activity of untested
chemicals with a high degree of confidence. This paper presents the uses of this 
type of SAR approach in a research laboratory.
