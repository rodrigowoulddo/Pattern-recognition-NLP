>16.Pharmacophoric pattern matching in files of three-dimensional chemical structures: implementation of flexible searching.
The conformational space of a flexible three-dimensional (3D) molecule can be
represented for searching purposes by a smoothed bounded distance matrix. Such
matrices provide an effective way of carrying out flexible searching, but search 
times can be very long when compared with rigid searches that take no account of 
conformational flexibility. This paper considers two techniques for minimizing
the computational requirements of flexible searching. In the first part, we
compare four different indices that have been suggested for the quantification of
molecular flexibility, and demonstrate that they produce comparable rankings of
sets of molecules in order of decreasing flexibility. We then demonstrate that
the prioritization of a set of structures in order of increasing flexibility can 
result in substantial reductions in the time requirements of flexible searching
if some fixed number of hit structures is desired. In the second part, we report 
an analysis of the 3D crystal structures in the Cambridge Structural Database to 
generate distance ranges that are tighter than those produced by distance
geometry. Experiments with a set of six query pharmacophores demonstrate that use
of these tightened ranges results in substantial reductions in search times, but 
that this may also lead to a reduction in the number of hit molecules obtained
from the final conformational search.
