>7. SAMSON: a software package for the biopolymer primary structure analysis.
The SAMSON package is a tool for advanced analysis of primary DNA, RNA and
protein structures. The package consists of 16 programs performing statistical
analysis and comparison of biopolymer sequences, search for homologies,
translation of DNA and RNA sequences into amino acid sequences, splicing of RNA
sequences and restriction map construction, recognition of functionally related
sites in biopolymer molecules, textual analysis of DNA and RNA regulatory sites
and prediction of intermolecular hybridization sites in DNA and RNA molecules.
