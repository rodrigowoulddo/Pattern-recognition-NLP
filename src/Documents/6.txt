>6. Bioinformatics in glycomics: glycan characterization with mass spectrometric data using SimGlycan.
Mass spectrometry (MS), with its low sample requirement and high sensitivity, has
been the predominantly used methodology for characterization and elucidation of
glycan structures. However, manual interpretation of MS data is complex and
tedious due to large number of product ions observed and also due to the
variation in their m/z values under various experimental conditions. We present
an automated tool, SimGlycan, for this purpose, which accepts raw/standard MS
data files as input and characterizes the associated glycan structure with high
accuracy using database searching and scoring techniques. Not only does it
predict the glycan structure using an MS/MS database searching technique, but it 
also facilitates predicting novel glycans by drawing a glycan and mapping it onto
an experimental spectrum to check the degree of proximity between the theoretical
and the experimental glycans. It serves as a platform for developing advanced
tools that may be used for glycopeptide identification using MS data and 3D
structural analysis of glycans with a few improvements in the existing features.
