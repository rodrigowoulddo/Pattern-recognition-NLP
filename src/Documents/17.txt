>17. Inhibitors of prolyl endopeptidase: characterization of the pharmacophoric pattern using conformational analysis and 3D-QSAR.
A structure-activity study has been carried out on several compounds known as
inhibitors of the serine protease prolyl endopeptidase. Conformational analysis
has been done using different molecular mechanics methods such as molecular
dynamics, or a randomized conformational search method. The conformers obtained
were classified using geometric and energetic criteria. A pattern recognition
analysis was done in order to divide conformers according to families. The
resulting dominant families, for all compounds investigated, showed very similar 
geometric features. Based on the lowest energy conformers obtained after
randomized conformational analysis, a 3D-QSAR model was established using the
CoMFA approach. The validity of this model was verified by predicting correctly
the activity of other molecules not used in the construction of this model.
