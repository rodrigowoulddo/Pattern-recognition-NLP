>5. Interactive design of generic chemical patterns.
Every medicinal chemist has to create chemical patterns occasionally for querying
databases, applying filters or describing functional groups. However, the
representations of chemical patterns have been so far limited to languages with
highly complex syntax, handicapping the application of patterns. Graphic pattern 
editors similar to chemical editors can facilitate the work with patterns. In
this article, we review the interfaces of frequently used web search engines for 
chemical patterns. We take a look at pattern editing concepts of standalone
chemical editors and finally present a completely new, unpublished graphical
approach to pattern design, the SMARTSeditor.
