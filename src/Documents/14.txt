>14.PdbMotif--a tool for the automatic identification and display of motifs in protein structures.
A program PdbMotif, which automatically identifies protein motifs in a protein
data bank file and generates a script file which can be read directly by the
molecular rendering program RasMol, is described. PdbMotif accepts the standard
PROSITE pattern syntax and will scan the PROSITE pattern database or a set of
user defined patterns. Any motifs detected are automatically highlighted in the
RasMol image.
