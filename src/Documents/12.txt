>12. Using diffusion distances for flexible molecular shape comparison.
BACKGROUND: Many molecules are flexible and undergo significant shape deformation
as part of their function, and yet most existing molecular shape comparison (MSC)
methods treat them as rigid bodies, which may lead to incorrect shape
recognition.
RESULTS: In this paper, we present a new shape descriptor, named Diffusion
Distance Shape Descriptor (DDSD), for comparing 3D shapes of flexible molecules. 
The diffusion distance in our work is considered as an average length of paths
connecting two landmark points on the molecular shape in a sense of inner
distances. The diffusion distance is robust to flexible shape deformation, in
particular to topological changes, and it reflects well the molecular structure
and deformation without explicit decomposition. Our DDSD is stored as a histogram
which is a probability distribution of diffusion distances between all sample
point pairs on the molecular surface. Finally, the problem of flexible MSC is
reduced to comparison of DDSD histograms.
CONCLUSIONS: We illustrate that DDSD is insensitive to shape deformation of
flexible molecules and more effective at capturing molecular structures than
traditional shape descriptors. The presented algorithm is robust and does not
require any prior knowledge of the flexible regions.
