>8. Domain discovery method for topological profile searches in protein structures.
We describe a method for automated domain discovery for topological profile
searches in protein structures. The method is used in a system TOPStructure for
fast prediction of CATH classification for protein structures (given as PDB
files). It is important for profile searches in multi-domain proteins, for which 
the profile method by itself tends to perform poorly. We also present an O(C(n)k 
+ nk(2)) time algorithm for this problem, compared to the O(C(n)k + (nk)(2)) time
used by a trivial algorithm (where n is the length of the structure, k is the
number of profiles and C(n) is the time needed to check for a presence of a given
motif in a structure of length n). This method has been developed and is
currently used for TOPS representations of protein structures and prediction of
CATH classification, but may be applied to other graph-based representations of
protein or RNA structures and/or other prediction problems. A protein structure
prediction system incorporating the domain discovery method is available at
